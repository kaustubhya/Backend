npm is used to manage all node and expressjs packages
use node i + tab to detect index.js file, in terminal and do enter to run it

Here we need to start node every time to run our index.js file, which is a hassle.

To solve this and make it automatic use 'Nodemon' package.

do - npm install -g nodemon 

now type nodemon

Now output will show on node terminal each time we save it. 
other option is to type 'rs' in the terminal.


// making servers in backend

first import http functions, see index.js.

IMP - MAKE SURE THE DIRECTORY IN TERMINAL IS RIGHT - i.e. /c/Backend/NodeJS

// Modules in NodeJS

Everything in NODEJS is a module.

3 types:

1. Built-In module (eg http)

2. Third Party Module (eg nodemon)

3. File Based Module

There can be only 1 export default.
