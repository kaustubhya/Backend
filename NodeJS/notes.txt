npm is used to manage all node and expressjs packages
use node i + tab to detect index.js file, in terminal and do enter to run it

Here we need to start node every time to run our index.js file, which is a hassle.

To solve this and make it automatic use 'Nodemon' package.

do - npm install -g nodemon 

now type nodemon

Now output will show on node terminal each time we save it. 
other option is to type 'rs' in the terminal.
